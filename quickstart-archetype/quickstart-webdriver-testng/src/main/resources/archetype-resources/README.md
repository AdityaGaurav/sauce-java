This project contains sample source code that demonstrates how to construct a TestNG test to run a
WebDriver against Sauce OnDemand.

It contains two classes, WebDriver.java, which is a pure-WebDriver test, and WebDriverWithHelper.java,
which demonstrates how to integrate the Sauce TestNG Helper classes.

The tests can be run by executing

    mvn package
